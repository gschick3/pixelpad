# pixelpad

## Description
Pixelpad is a simple grid-layout pixel drawing canvas. This project was created to practice integrating the DOM with Javascript

## Use
The canvas starts at 10x10 squares and can be changed using the number inputs at the top of the page. The reset button will clear the canvas and update its size to the input. Right-clicking on the canvas will also reset it.  
To draw an image, select the color you want to use and click on a square on the grid. If you click on the square again with the same color selected, it will erase the square. If you have selected a different color, it will changed the square to that color.
